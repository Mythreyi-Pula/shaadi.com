            Ours is an arranged marriage but I would not agree because I fell in love with her with every day passing. Since the day(i.e. 4th March 2015) Raman accepted my interest on Shaadi.com my life changed. I never thought some one sitting so far in Canada would make me feel loved the way I felt. Initial Chats and conversation made us understand each other well and we started talking for hours on phone and skype. Finally, we talked to our parents and they took the conversation ahead through phone calls. To take it further Ramanpreet's Mother asked us to meet her uncle living in Patiala, India as she was with Ramanpreet in Canada at that time. We went to patiala to meet her uncle Karnail Singh Arora (Mother's Brother) on 8th of April, 2015 and had a healthy conversation and got an approval for the alliance.We were very happy and we fixed the dates in the mean while. Every thing went good and the eagerness to meet her in person went to an extreme level. Finally she told me that she had applied for the leaves and will be coming on 11 of October 2015. I cant explain how much happy I was. On 21st September her mother came back to India and we had a formal meeting and we had Roka in Gurudwara saheb. I loved the feeling her mother was so warming and uncle from patiala was also there along with my parents and sister. Finally the day came when she landed on Indira Gandhi International Airport and I went to pick her up alone with some flowers. I saw her coming out and my heart started pounding. I was nervous as I saw her first time. She looked beautiful I loved the way she hugged me. We went for our first date to Wok In clouds in Rajouri garden, New Delhi. We had a Pre Wedding shoot on 13th of October at Humayun's Tomb, New Delhi. It was the day when i first time felt so much of love. Meeting in person was a different feeling and I loved it. We started shopping for the rest of the time left and had an engagement ceremony on 24th of October 2015 followed by the wedding on 25th of October 2015. Since the day my life changed completely and I am a lot more happier and satisfied then I was ever in my life. Thanks to Shadi.com for such an alliance. Gob Bless you and your team.
